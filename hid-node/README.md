# Hypersign Identity Network
The Hypersign Identity Network is a permissionless blockchain network to manage digital identity and access rights. It aims to empower humans to gain control of their data and access on the internet by providing scalable, interoperable and secure verifiable data registry (VDR) to implement use cases on Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. The Hypersign Identity Network is built using Cosmos-SDK and is fully compatible with W3C DID specifications.
